# What is the Map of Life?

The Map of Life is an web application that's currently being developed through a collaboration between Yale and the University of Colorado at Boulder. It integraties species distribution knowledge in an effort to support global understanding of the world's biodiversity. The resulting product will provide a knowledge-bases platform for species distribution maps, along with a set of tools for querying, accessing, downloading, and summarizing them. 

# Implementation

The application rides on [CartoDB](https://github.com/vizzuality/cartodb), an open source tool for accessing and visualizing geospatial data on the web, on [Google Earth Engine](http://earthengine.google.org), a parallel processing platform that surfaces algoritthms to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the earth's surface, and is hosted on [Google App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine).
