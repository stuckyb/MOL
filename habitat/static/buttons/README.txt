To create one of these buttons in GIMP:
1. Start with an image of any size with a transparent background.
2. Use the "Arial Rounded MT Bold" font which ships with MacOS X.
    -> http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?fmid=918
    -> At some point, we should really switch to using a free font here.
        -> For the Dashboard button, I tried to use the open-source font
           "Liberation Sans Bold", which is designed to be similar to
           Arial.
3. Font size should be 16px.
4. Autocrop.
5. Increase the canvas size to a height of 19px approximately.
6. Rotate left.
7. Try it out.
    For symmetry/aesthetic reasons, you'll probably have to tweak the image a little
    at this point. For instance, the "Status" button needs an extra pixel on top.

Please see Status-work.xcf for a "behind the scenes" look at how I made status_fr.png. -- Gaurav, May 10, 2012.
